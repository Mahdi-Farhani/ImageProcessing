### 📚 Documentation Index (Table of Contents)

Below is the complete documentation index for the ImageProcessing Playground project.

Each document is written in English and organized for clarity, modularity, and professional engineering workflows.
---
1. [Architecture](architecture.md)
Describes the internal system structure, folder hierarchy, design patterns (Strategy, etc.), the flow between API → Registry → Metric, and responsibilities of each module.

2. [Distance Metrics](distance-metrics.md)
Mathematical definitions, formulas, properties, and usage for all implemented distance metrics, including Euclidean, Manhattan, Chebyshev, Minkowski, Cosine, and Hamming.

3. [API Design](api-design.md)
Public interface specifications, parameter rules, instantiation logic, Minkowski p‑value handling, and examples illustrating how to interact with the system.

4. [Examples](example.md)
A complete collection of runnable examples showcasing how each distance metric is used through the unified API.

5. [Roadmap]()
Planned algorithms (SSIM, LPIPS, Hausdorff, EMD, etc.), future improvements, performance upgrades, and long‑term goals for the project.
