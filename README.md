# Image Processing Playground

A growing collection of Python-based image processing exercises, utility functions, and small experimental programs.  
This repository is primarily designed for my own learning and exploration, but is structured and documented so others can benefit as well.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains:

- Fundamental image processing implementations (filters, transformations, histogram operations, etc.)
- Reusable utility functions for common processing tasks
- Mini‑projects and experiment scripts developed along the way
- Clean, modular Python code designed to be extended over time

The goal is to build a practical, evolving toolbox for understanding and experimenting with core concepts in image processing.

---

## 🧰 Features

- Pure Python + NumPy + OpenCV (and optionally SciPy/Matplotlib)
- Modular structure for easy navigation and reuse
- Each function/script focuses on clarity and educational value
- Incrementally expanding as I progress through exercises

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
Typical libraries used:

- numpy  
- opencv-python  
- matplotlib  
- scipy  

### 2. Run any script
```
python basics/thresholding.py
```
or explore notebooks:
```
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

## 📘 Exercises & Concepts Covered

The repository will gradually include implementations of topics such as:

- Image loading, color spaces, and visualization  
- Convolution, smoothing, and sharpening filters  
- Edge detection (Sobel, Canny, Laplacian)  
- Morphological operations  
- Histograms & histogram equalization  
- Geometric transformations  
- Noise models + denoising techniques  
- Frequency-domain processing  
- And more as the learning path evolves...

## 🧪 Mini Projects

From time to time, small standalone programs will be added, such as:

- Simple image enhancement tools  
- Interactive demos  
- Benchmarking scripts  
- Algorithm comparison experiments
